** Request Data

This is documentation of the Webmachine Request Data API as embodied
by the =wrq= module. This module is the means by which resources
access and manipulate the state of the request they are handling.

Given that all Webmachine resource functions have the following
signature:

```erlang
f(ReqData, Context) -> {Result, ReqData, Context}
```

we should explain in detail the =ReqData= input and output
parameter. This is a data structure used to represent the request sent
by the client as well as the response being built by the resource. The
=wrq= module is used to access the values in the input parameter. Most
functions in most resources have no need to modify the output
=ReqData= and can simply pass along the one received as
input. However, in some cases a resource will need to make some update
to the response other than that implied by =Result= and in those cases
it should use the =wrq= module to build a modified =ReqData= from the
original one for the return value.

** Types

A couple of nonstandard types are assumed here:

| Type             | Description                                          |
|------------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| =string()=       | a =list()= with all elements in the ASCII range      |
| =rd()=           | opaque record, used as the input/output =ReqData=    |
| =streambody()=   | A Webmachine [[Webmachine-Streamed-Body.html][streamed body format]]                    |
| =mochiheaders()= | a structure used in mochiweb for HTTP header storage |

** Functions
