h2. Webmachine decision flow

This diagram is illustrative of the flow of processing that a webmachine resource goes through from inception to response.

Version 1 of this diagram, from Alan Dean, was the inspiration for webmachine_decision_core. Versions 2 and 3 were created in collaboration between Alan Dean and Justin Sheehy.

A copy of v3 is found in the webmachine source tree for convenience.
