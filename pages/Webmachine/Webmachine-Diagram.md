This diagram is illustrative of the flow of processing that a
Webmachine resource goes through from inception to response.

Version 1 of this diagram, from Alan Dean, was the inspiration for
`webmachine_decision_core`. Versions 2 and 3 were created in
collaboration between Alan Dean and Justin Sheehy.

A copy of version 3 is found in the Webmachine source tree for
convenience.
