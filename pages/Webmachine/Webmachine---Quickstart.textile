Make sure that you have a working Erlang/OTP release, R12B5 or later.

Get the webmachine code:
```bash
git clone git://github.com/basho/webmachine
```

Build webmachine:
```bash
cd webmachine
make
```

Create, build, and start the skeleton resource:
```bash
./scripts/new_webmachine.erl mywebdemo /tmp
cd /tmp/mywebdemo
make
./start.sh
```

Take a look! Point a web browser at @http://localhost:8000/@

To make this resource handle URI paths other than @/@, add more [[dispatch|Webmachine---Request-Dispatching]] terms in @/tmp/mywebdemo/priv/dispatch.conf@; to make that [[resource|Webmachine---Resources]] do more interesting things, modify the resource itself at @/tmp/mywebdemo/src/mywebdemo_resource.erl@.

To learn how to do more interesting things, check out [[some examples|Webmachine---Resource-Examples]].
